# Standalone converter from json to HDF5/Nexus

This is a development tool to help with designing the final shape of our Nexus App definition. The script here is part of the Nion Swift Nexus exporter being worked on by Sherjeel Shabih.

## Usage:

***input.json*** is the file exported by Nion Swift in this example.

***translation.json*** is a list of entries in the format: "/path/hierarchy/in/input.json": {"path": "/path/hierarchy/to/output.nxs", "unit": "kV", "desc": "It's the beam energy"},
You make a list of these and the program can automatically map the paths accordingly. It does not touch the paths that have no translation. So they are a 1:1 copy.
This is really to help us during development and to see how the final structure can look like without changing any code.
Later this code will be a part of Nion Swift to have a use with Open Source acquisition tools.

***output.nxs*** is the output Nexus file generated by the script.

```
python json_to_nexus.py
```

Or with parameters to choose the filenames:

```
python json_to_nexus.py --input input.json --transaltion translation.json --output output.nxs
```

### Other details

You can really map the output however you like. Whether it's a leaf in the JSON tree structure or just another node. The code will handle nesting further or pulling out the structure as you imagine. Please refer to the example translation.json.
