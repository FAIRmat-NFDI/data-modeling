    dispersion_x(NXdispersion):
      doc: |
        The dispersion along the optical axis of the material.
        This should be the only dispersion available for isotropic materials.
        For uniaxial materials this denotes the ordinary axis.
        For biaxial materials this denotes the x axis or epsilon 11 tensor element
        of the diagionalized permittivity tensor.
