        Ideally, a (globally) unique persistent identifier 
        for referring to this experiment.
        
        The identifier is usually defined/issued by the facility, laboratory,
        or the principle investigator. The identifier enables to link 
        experiments to e.g. proposals.

        Free-text description about the experiment.
        
        Users are strongly advised to detail the sample history in the 
        respective field and fill rather as completely as possible the fields
        of this application definition rather than write details about the
        experiment into this free-text description field.
    start_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
      doc: |
        ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information

    end_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
      doc: |
        ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information
        included when the measurement ended.

          Program version plus build number, commit hash, or description of an
          ever persistent resource where the source code of the program and
          build instructions can be found so that the program can be configured
          in such a manner that the result file is ideally recreatable
          yielding the same results.

# also here the concept one specimen "multiple experiments"
# concept of an experimentCollection requiring
#   machine identifier
#   guid/uuid
#   Bruker implements application definitions which store metadata about backward compatibility
# for Bruker the XRR.brml example decompresses as follows:
#   Experiment0/
#              /ActiveContentContainer.xml
#              /EvaluationContainer.xml
#              /PreMeasContainer.xml
#              /TemplateContainer.xml (all four time stamping and UUIDs, i.e. likely software state tracking)

#              /DataContainer.xml (key metadata related to user and scan scheme pointing to RawData0)
#              /RawData0.xml (proprietary naming and details about motors etc. and visited conditions in "DataRoutes/DataRoute", each position one "Datum")

#              /InstructionContainer.xml (a deeply nested graph of with a "s***load of proprietary metadata)
#              /MeasurementContainer.xml (motor state and drive speed settings among other)

# what are these containers? Let's explore:
# Bruker conceptualizes a Camera monitoring the instrument
# and what is stored in the BSML files ? or where are really the counts?
