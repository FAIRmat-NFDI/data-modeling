# Sub-appdefs incl. examples

## Points to discuss
- Should have working examples for any sub-appdef <span style="color:red">new feature</span> <span style="color:green">discussion</span>
- base class inheritance? <span style="color:green">discussion</span>	
- NXarpes_timeresolved? <span style="color:green">discussion</span>

## List of possible appdefs
- NXpeem
- NXmpes_arpes
- NXmpes_xps
- NXmpes_liqud
- Pump probe or spin resolved appdef to mix into NXmpes and others

# Decisions
- We will build sub-applications before the workshop. That way we are able to fix the values in the super-classes and see if there are any problems. We will, however, not present the sub-appdefs to the technology partners but only give an overview.
