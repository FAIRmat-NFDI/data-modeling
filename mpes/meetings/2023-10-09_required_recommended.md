# Discussion points

## Required vs recommended
- Do we really need the required elements? (only for a specific application, or for being FAIR, for reproducibility? what do we mean by being required by the community) -> FAIR levels? discussion
- user? shall it be required? shall we argue that scientific publication does require it? discussion

# Decisions
- Required fields reflect the bare minimum which is considered an, e.g., NXmpes experiment. Recommeded should reflect what we would consider a FAIRer dataset.
- (NXuser) recommended. name and affiliation required

# ToDos
