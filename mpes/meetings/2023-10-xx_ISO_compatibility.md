## Points to discuss
- Follow Iso18155 Naming structure documentation <span style="color:green">discussion</span>
    - ISO18115:: use the names of techniques/terms
    - Get copy of ISO Standard (ISO 18115-1:2023) (+Ontologies??) and work through it. What could we use from it and how?
- shall we support an extra field for this? <span style="color:green">discussion</span>
- Follow the "Minimum reporting requirement" -> there is an ISO standard https://www.iso.org/standard/66294.html?browse=tc <span style="color:orange">documentation</span>
