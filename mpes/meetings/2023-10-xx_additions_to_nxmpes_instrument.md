# Additions to current NXmpes -> Instrument

## Points to discuss
- Use NXfabrication to specify Vendor, Model, S/N etc. of any given instrument, component <span style="color:blue">add from existing</span>
- Add a NXtransformation to NXenergydispersion <span style="color:blue">add from existing</span>
- Allow for torroidal analyzers <span style="color:blue">add from existing</span>
- There was the request to have an NXcalibration class to be attached to e.g. any voltage or so, which can contain calibration data, and e.g. also a DOI link. <span style="color:blue">add from existing</span>
- devise a generic NXresolution base class, that allows specifying how the resolution is determined, and instanciating this for the respective resolutions. make those recommended <span style="color:red">new feature</span> <span style="color:green">discussion</span>
- Allow for multiple angular resolutions (perp/parallel to a slit) <span style="color:red">new feature</span>
- Is "Probe" redundant? <span style="color:green">discussion</span>
