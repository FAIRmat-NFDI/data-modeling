## Points to discuss
- calibration and calibration-history, or instrument history <span style="color:red">new feature</span>
<span style="color:green">discussion</span>
    - NXprocedure and/or NXinstrument_history? Similar to NXsample_history?
    - Instrument history: calibrations, lifetime, ... 
    - How do we deal which a history of instrument calibration? Do we only give the latest? Is there some sort of quality factor depending on how much time has passed since the last calibration? <span style="color:green">discussion</span>
- Legacy data management: what are current standard procedures? <span style="color:purple">research</span>
