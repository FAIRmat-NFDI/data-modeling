def YAML_to_template_data_dict(yaml_file):
    ``` 
    Creates a template dict object for the reader func with all the paths
    generated using the working YAML definition file. This will help by just
    having a list to fill in rather than expecting the author of reader func
    to figure it out
    ```
    return template_data_dict

def reader(filename, template_data_dict):
    ```
        template_data_dict is all the paths in the working YAML file with already populated keys. The data needs to be added by this function
    ```
    template_data_dict["/path/to/an/entry/in/the/yaml"] = [data_object]
    return template_data_dict

def nxdl_to_attr_obj(path):
    ```
    Finds the path entry in NXDL file
    Grabs all the attrs in NXDL entry
    Checks Nexus base application defs for missing attrs and adds them as well
    returns attr as a Python obj that can be directly placed into the h5py library
    ```
    attrs['@class'] = 'nxentry'
    attrs['unit'] = 'km'
    return attrs



def writer(data_dict, output_path):
    Goes through the data_dict
        Takes every key
        looks it up in the NXDL - nxdl_to_attr_obj(path)
        Sets up the Nexus object with attrs
        Goes back to the data_dict and copy out the actual data and write it to Nexus
