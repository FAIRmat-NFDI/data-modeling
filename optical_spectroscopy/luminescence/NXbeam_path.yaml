# A draft of a new base class to describe a beam path consisting of one or
# more optical elements (e.g. a beam path in a luminescence setup).

  A beam path consisting of one or more optical elements.

  NXbeam_path is used in NXluminescence to describe the beam path, i.e. the
  arrangement of optical elements between the excitation source and the 
  sample or between the sample and the detector unit.

(NXbeam_path):
  doc: "Describe the relevant optical elements in the beam path by using
        the appropriate sub classes. You may use as many elements as needed,
        also several elements of the same type."

  # Should we define intensity (loss), polarization state (before/after),
  #   beam profile etc.?

  # Define or use base classes NXlens_opt, NXfilter (defined), NXfiber, 
  #     NXmirror (defined), NXprism, NXpolarizer_opt (NXpolarizer is spin 
  #     polarizer), NXaperture (defined), NXpinhole (defined), 
  #     NXdisk_chopper (defined), NXgrating (defined), waveplate/retarder
  # Some of the classes might be similar, so one has to decide which one to use

  (NXpinhole):
    # doc: "A simple pinhole."

  (NXslit):
    # doc: "A simple slit."
    # For more complex geometries, NXaperture should be used.

  (NXaperture):
    # NeXus manual: 'A beamline aperture. This group is deprecated, use NXslit
    # instead.'
    # also, duplicates NXpinhole?

  (NXcrystal):
    # doc: "A crystal monochromator or analyzer."

  (NXmirror):

  (NXfilter): # Should we merge NXpolarizer and NXfilter?

  (NXattenuator):
    # doc: "A device that reduces the intensity of a beam by attenuation."
    # another variant of NXfilter? i.e. neutral density filter

  (NXgrating):
    doc: "A diffraction grating. Define relevant parameters in the
          corresponding fields, e.g. order of diffration (diffraction_order)
          or angular dispersion (angular_dispersion)."

    type:
      exists: recommended
      doc: "Define the type of the grating (e.g. SR or VPH grating)."

    angular_dispersion(NX_NUMBER):
      doc: "Dispersion of the grating in nm/mm."

  (NXdisk_chopper): 
    # doc: "A chopper, i.e. a device blocking the beam in a temporal periodic
    #      pattern."

  (NXpolarizer):
    #CE: Should we define a new base class, e.g. NXpolarizer_opt?
    # NXpolarizer is the base class that describes a spin polarizer, so the
    # base class would have to be modified.
  
  # ====== New base classes (need to be created): ======

  (NXpolarizer_opt):
    #CE: Instead of using NXpolarizer
    # define: type (dichroic, linear, circular etc.), angle/position,
    #         transmissivity, reflectivity, coating, Brewster angle, ...

  (NXbeam_splitter):
    doc: "A beam splitter splitting the light beam in two."
    # could infer that two independent NXbeam_path follow (unless it is part of a confocal setup splitting the excitation and detection paths)

  (NXwaveplate): # or NXretarder?
    doc: "A device that changes the polarization state of a light beam."
    # define: type (lambda/2, lambda/4 etc.), material, index of refraction

  (NXlens_opt):
    doc: "An optical lens."
    # define: type (convex, concave etc.), material, index of refraction,
    #         focal length, curvature, thickness, coating, reflection ...
    # Note: NXlens_em is a new base class defined for electro-magnetic or
    #       compund lenses (used in e.g. NXapm)

  (NXfiber): # or NXwaveguide? Can we use/modify NXguide?
    doc: "An optical fiber."
    # define: type/mode, material, refractive index, length, wavelength range,
    #         bandwidth or transfer rate, numerical aperture (angle)
