# a draft version of a NeXus application definition for luminescence experiments

# 
# [x] Structure: excitation(+beam path) - sample(+stage) - detection(+beam path)
#       ... all in NXinstrument, or should sample be separate?
#       We could have excitation(+beam path), stage, and detection(+beam path)
#       in NXinstrument and NXsample outside. This (separate NXinstrument and
#       NXsample) seems to be the common way in application definitions.
# [ ] Get in touch with NeXus people and ask how to best proceed: do they
#       suggest to either modifying existing base classes or creating new ones?
#       For example, NXpolarizer is defined for a spin polarizer, but we would
#       like to use a class for optical polarizers. Should we create a new class
#       (e.g. NXoptpolarizer) or extend the existing class NXpolarizer so we can
#       use it as well?
# [x] We could create a base class for optics (optical elements describing a
#       beam path). => see NXbeam_path.yaml
# [ ] Would it make sense to create a base class NXstage which could be used in
#       most application def.? How to they handle this in NeXus? 
#       Maybe use NXstage_lab?
# [ ] Which experimental methods (already defined application definitions) are
#       similar to our situation with luminescence?
#       We should ask some people, e.g. Tommaso Pincelli (ARPES, MPES)
# [ ] Should Raman spectrocopy be included? It is very similar to
#       photoluminescence, so it would make sense to incorporate it into the
#       luminescence app. def. - see issue #33 on github
#       (https://github.com/FAIRmat-Experimental/data-modeling/issues/33)
# [x] How to work together? Shared folder? Carola will create a folder on
#       gitlab. Update: The repositories on gitlab will be moved to github, so
#       we can use github instead. Here is the link to the github repo:
