#a draft version of a NeXus application definition for ellipsometry
name: NXellipsometry_base_draft
doc: draft application definition for ellipsometry measurements, including complex systems up to variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry.
# the document has the following main elements:
# experimental procedure
# instrument used and is characteristics
# measured data, the discription of the sample and what was measured about it
# derived parameters: extra parameters derived in the measurement software

# Markus comment:
# angle_of_incidence: outer or inner surface normal?
# instrument/company: suggesting "Name of the company which build the instrument"
# instrument/hardware_version: you mean serial number
# instrument/software_version: I would split name and version+buildnumber
# instrument/light_source: Would it make sense to have an enum or a free-text?
# instrument/ellipsometry_type: We should give a doi in the doc
# instrument/calibration/calibration_time: I would go for a specific date (including time) instead of a free text
# instrument/calibration/calibration_provided: The doc is confusing, would you like to say that the measured data from the calibration are included?
# instrument/calibration/calibration_data: Straight-through, is this a clear term for everybody?
# instrument/calibration/calibration_data/calibration_data: doc not defined what should be in there?
# instrument/angle_of_incidence: How to you define positive rotations, I assume right-handed, counter-clockwise?
# dunno about the target syntax?
# instrument/window: "its" in the last sentence is unclear, to what does it refer?

      doc: The stage coordinate system vs. the incident beam. The stage is parallel to the sample, and the sample is considered flat. The Z-axis points to the direction of the surface normal of the substrate. The beam comes with angle of incidence but opposite direction, thus they are connected with a rotation of 180 - angle of incidence (in degrees). --> UNCLEAR! <-- This transformation brings us from the NEXUS coordinates to the stage coordinates.
      #is does the beam illumination direction vector always be coupled to the stage or can you transform the stage, beam and sample?

      doc: to identify what is measured and how, we have to define the sample relative to the instrument. The basic coordinate  system is defined by the beam.
