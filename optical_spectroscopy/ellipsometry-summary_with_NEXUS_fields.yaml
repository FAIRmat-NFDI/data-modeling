#a draft version of a NeXus application definition for ellipsometry

# the document has the following main elements:
# instrument used and is characteristics
# measured data, the discription of the sample and what was measured about it
# derived parameters: extra parameters derived in the measurement software

# one would need a Class/ separate entry for the sample description which can link to and should contain a full description of the composition. A free description as text might be not enough or unclear. Especially if one deals with many layer structured samples and optically anisotropic samples, like triclinic one

# Comments are moved to the Development_notes.md file
