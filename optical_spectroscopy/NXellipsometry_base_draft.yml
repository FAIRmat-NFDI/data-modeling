#a draft version of a NeXus application definition for ellipsometry

# the document has the following main elements:
# experimental procedure
# instrument used and is characteristics
# measured data, the discription of the sample and what was measured about it
# derived parameters: extra parameters derived in the measurement software

# Markus comment to the draft for FAIRmat AreaB Sprint3:
# angle_of_incidence: outer or inner surface normal?
# instrument/company: suggesting "Name of the company which build the instrument"
# instrument/hardware_version: you mean serial number
# instrument/software_version: I would split name and version+buildnumber
# instrument/light_source: Would it make sense to have an enum or a free-text?
# instrument/ellipsometry_type: We should give a doi in the doc
# instrument/calibration/calibration_time: I would go for a specific date (including time) instead of a free text
# instrument/calibration/calibration_provided: The doc is confusing, would you like to say that the measured data from the calibration are included?
# instrument/calibration/calibration_data: Straight-through, is this a clear term for everybody?
# instrument/calibration/calibration_data/calibration_data: doc not defined what should be in there?
# instrument/angle_of_incidence: How to you define positive rotations, I assume right-handed, counter-clockwise?
# dunno about the target syntax?
# instrument/window: "its" in the last sentence is unclear, to what does it refer?
# should further fields from NXentry on timing (end_time, duration, etc.) be included?
# wavelength doc string: "make the others accessible", you mean others = values ?
# stage docstring reads too colloquial to me
# sample_rotation/alternative is unclear
# there is a dangling calibration field under window? where should this belong?
