# application definitions for optical spectroscpy
This field includes all kind of UV/VIS/IR light based optical spectroscopic methods.
While there are several variations of such experiments, we can start with a simple disctinction:
 - transmission measurements detecting the transmitted light intensity (either as transmission percent or absorbance)
 - reflection measurements often characterizing the surface, and layers of coatings on the surface

# optical ellipsometry
this application definitions covers a broad range of methods describing sample surfaces analyzing the polarization state of light before and after being reflected from the surface. This may spread from a single wavelength measurement at few angles to a variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE).
