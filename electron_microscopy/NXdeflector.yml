Conventions from the NXtransformations base class are used. In principle, the McStas coordinate system is used. The origin of the coordinate system is placed in the center of the gun pinhole as the virtual point-like assumed source of the electron beam. A right-handed coordinate system is assumed whose positive z-axis points in the direction of the propagating electron beam."
