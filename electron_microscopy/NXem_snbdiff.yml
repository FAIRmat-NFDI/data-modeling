#using NXem_draft class to instantiate an application definition for scanning nanobeam diffraction.
category: application
doc: Application definition for storing data and metadata for experiments with (scanning and transmission) electron microscopy, specifically for scanning nanobeam diffraction in a transmission electron microscope.
symbols:
  doc: The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays
  imageid: Frame or given number to distinguish different images in a stack
  ypos: Pixel coordinate in the slow-changing direction
  xpos: Pixel coordinate in the fast-changing direction
  nimages: Total number of images in the imagestack
  ny: Number of pixel along the slow-changing direction
  nx: Number of pixel along the fast-changing direction
