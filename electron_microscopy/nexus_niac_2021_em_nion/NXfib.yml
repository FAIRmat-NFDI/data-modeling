#draft for a base class which can describe all those components of an (electron) microscope which equips it with focused-ion-beam (FIB) milling capabilities. FIB is a material preparation technique whereby the sample is milled with a focused ion beam to remove material in a controlled manner. The technique enables site-specific preparation. One of the key application cases is in a scanning electron microscope / focused-ion beam instrument (SEM/FIB). The fact that a second gun and relevant control and focusing devices are needed warrants an own class.
