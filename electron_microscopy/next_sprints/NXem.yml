# template of a draft NeXus application definition for the field of electron microscopy
# An electron microscope is, like most contemporary instruments for advanced materials characterization, a complex instrument with sets of many components with internal hierarchies of components.
# Components include hardware, control logics, and software tools. The application definition stores a coarse-grained representation of this complexity.
# Different levels of detailed technical component hierarchies can be injected and the corresponding geometrical arrangement of the components in relation to one another be modelled.
# With such an approach it is possible to define digital twins of e.g. the entire column of the instrument to instantiate e.g. ray-tracing simulations.
# Instances of NXtransformations describe the location and geometrical situation of the components relative to the optical axis/electron beam path.
# Complementarily, instances of NXprocess(es) describe settings, parameters, i.e. metadata, and the numerical data from an electron microscopy experiment.
# Common examples are the indexing of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX(S)) scans, the time-averaging of images captured with high-frame rate capable 
# direct electron detectors, or the online processing of (Kikuchi) diffraction pattern in techniques like electron backscatter diffraction.

    program_name:
      doc: Commercial or otherwise given name to the program which was used to acquire/measure the dataset. Electron microscopy experiments are usually controlled/performed via commercial integrated acquisition and instrument control software. In many cases, an EM dataset is useful only if gets post-processed already during the acquisition or shortly thereafter, i.e. while the scientists is still sitting at the microscope. Many of these processes are automated, if not they virtually involve GUI interactions with the control software. Examples include collecting of diffraction pattern and on-the-fly indexing of these. These situations and tools are realized with individual NXprocess groups which can hold more details and numerical data to these processing steps. Frequently, some of these NXprocess groups are performed with (open-source) research software. Therefore, there is strictly speaking not a single program used in electron microscopy, and thus each NXprocess has its own program name and description."
