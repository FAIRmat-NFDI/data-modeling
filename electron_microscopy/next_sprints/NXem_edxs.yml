    program_name:
      doc: Commercial or otherwise given name to the program which was used to acquire/measure the dataset. Electron microscopy experiments are usually controlled/performed via commercial integrated acquisition and instrument control software. In many cases, an EM dataset is useful only if gets post-processed already during the acquisition or shortly thereafter, i.e. while the scientists is still sitting at the microscope. Many of these processes are automated, if not they virtually involve GUI interactions with the control software. Examples include collecting of diffraction pattern and on-the-fly indexing of these. These situations and tools are realized with individual NXprocess groups which can hold more details and numerical data to these processing steps. Frequently, some of these NXprocess groups are performed with (open-source) research software. Therefore, there is strictly speaking not a single program used in electron microscopy, and thus each NXprocess has its own program name and description."
