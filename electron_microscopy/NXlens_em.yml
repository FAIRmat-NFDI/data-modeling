doc: Draft class definition for electro-magnetic lenses as they are used e.g. in an electron microscope or reflectron device in a local electrode atom probe microscope.
(NXlens_em):
  type:
    exists: required
    doc: Qualitative type of lens with respect to the number of pole pieces
    enumeration: [single, double, quadrupole, hexapole, octopol]
  name:
    doc: Colloquial or short name for the lens. For manufacturer names and identifiers use respective manufacturer fields.
  manufacturer_name:
    doc: Name of the manufacturer who built/constructed the lens.
  manufacturer_model:
    doc: Hardware name, hash identifier, or serial number that was given by the manufacturer to identify the lens.
  description:
    doc: Ideally an identifier, persistent link, or free text which gives further details about the lens.
  (NXtransformations):
    doc: Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe the location and geometry of the corrector as a component in the instrument. Conventions from the NXtransformations base class are used. In principle, the McStas coordinate system is used. The origin of the coordinate system is placed in the center of the gun pinhole as the virtual point-like assumed source of the electron beam. A right-handed coordinate system is assumed whose positive z-axis points in the direction of the propagating electron beam.
    position:
      \@transformation_type:
        doc: Following transformation_type argument of NXtranslations but allowed value is only translation.
      \@vector(NX_NUMBER):
        doc: Following vector argument of NXtranslations. The translation actively brings the coordinate system under depends_on into registration with a coordinate system in the center of the lens.
      \@depends_on:
        doc: Enter the path where the reference coordinate system for the instrument is defined.
