# draft for a base class which can describe the components of the scan box. This is a device in an electron microscope which guides the electron beam to a 
# specific location on the specimen according to a scan schema. A scan schema is a protocol for measuring a set of positions arranged according to 
# geometric primitives (points, lines, rectangles, spirals, free-form curves).
