doc: Draft class definition for a component in an electron microscope which can be used to correct spherical aberration 
(NXem_c3c5corr):
  doc: A device for correcting spherical aberrations of an electromagnetic lens.
  name:
    doc: Colloquial (or short) name for the corrector. For manufacturer names and identifiers use respective manufacturer fields.
  manufacturer_name:
    doc: Name of the manufacturer who built/constructed the corrector.
  manufacturer_model:
    doc: Hardware name or hash identifier given by the manufacturer to identify the corrector.
  description:
    doc: Ideally an identifier, link, or free-text which gives further details about the component.
  (NXtransformations):
    doc: "Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe the location and geometry of the corrector as a component in e.g. a microscope. We follow the conventions in the NXtransformations base class. Therefore, consult NXtransformations for further details. This implies that we use in principle the McSTAS coordinate system. We make two key modifications though, we place the origin of the coordinate system in the center of the gun pinhole as this is an identifiable component of the electron gun of an electron microscope for which we can ignore the detailed geometry of the gun component design. A right-handed coordinate system is assumed whose z-axis is assumed to be parallel to the optical axis. Positive means in the direction of the propagating electrons."
    position:
      \@transformation_type:
        doc: Following transformation_type argument of NXtranslations but allowed value is only translation.
        enumeration: [translation]
      \@vector(NX_NUMBER):
        doc: Following vector argument of NXtranslations. The translation actively brings the coordinate system under depends_on into registration with the reference coordinate system in the gun.
      \@depends_on:
        doc: Enter the path where the reference coordinate system for the microscope is defined. Use "." if it is the root, i.e. the reference coordinate system of the instrument.
