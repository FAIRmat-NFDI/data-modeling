#a draft version of a NeXus application definition for electron microscopy
#the draft describes primarily components of an electron microscope to motivate the need for a base class for enabling the description of electron microscopes
#the example here illustrates also how a specific experiment with an electron microscope, scanning nanobeam diffraction in a transmission electron microscope could be described using these components in the class
#These components can be used to create a general template for electron microscopy application definitions. In detail an electron microscope is, like most contemporary instruments for advanced materials characterization,
#a complex instrument with sets of many components with internal hierarchies of hardware components and associated software control units. The class coarse-grains this complexity to the level of how the components are
#presented in contemporary instruments to normal microscopy users, like PhD students. Using the general NXlens_em class the example of the NXem_c3c5corr class shows how these components can be connected to resolve
#a more complicated and convering description of the internals of the instrument with a focus on building e.g. digiral twins of the instrument. Such an application definition for instantiating e.g. the entire column
#of the instrument digitally to perform e.g. ray-tracing simulation is not the purpose of the application definition but should be possible with making more fine-grained additions of the hard- and software layers.
#Here, instances of NXtransformations describe the location and geometrical situation of the components relative to the optical axis/electron beam path. Complementarily, instances of NXprocess can be used to describe
#numerical data processing steps which happen to modify the data immediately after their acquisition. Common examples are time-averaging of images which are taken with high-frame rate capable direct electron detectors, 
#or the online processing of (Kikuchi) diffraction pattern in techniques like electron backscatter diffraction.
