doc: Draft proposal for a NXobject class for representing electrostatic lens-type components in an atom probe microscope which can be used for representing reflectrons.
(NXobject):
  doc: Specifying an optionally installed reflectron which creates an electric field with which ion flight times can be equalized causing ions of higher energy to take longer pathways to the detector.
  type:
    doc: Qualify the type of reflectron which qualifies the shape of the used electric field.
    enumeration: [straight, curved]
  (NXtransformations):
    doc: Geometrical description how the reflectron is spatially arranged (relative to the specimen).
