category: contributed
doc: Proposal for storing mathematical models of peaks, their functional form or at least support.
symbols:
  doc: The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays
  Nsupport: Number of support points
(NXobject):
  exists: required
  peak_model:
    exists: required
    doc: Is the peak described analytically or with data i.e. intensity as a function of independent variable.
    enumeration: [empirical, gaussian, lorentz, ...]
  positions(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: In the case of only a data description of the peak and its shoulders, the positions were independent variable values were taken.
    unit: NX_ANY
    dimensions:
      rank: 1
      dim: [[1, Nsupport]]
  intensity(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: In the case of only a data description of the peak and its shoulders, the intensity at these.
    unit: NX_ANY
    dimensions:
      rank: 1
      dim: [[1, Nsupport]]
  (NXcollection):
    doc: In the case of an analytical description parameter of the functional form. For example in the case of Gaussian peaks mu, sigma, and cut-off values and background intensity.
