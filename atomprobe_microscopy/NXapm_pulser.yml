category: contributed
doc: Draft for a class which can be used for representing a coarsed description of those components of an atom probe microscope which trigger the pulsing whether it be a laser or high voltage pulsing unit.
(NXobject):
  laser_pulser(NXsource):
    exists: optional
    doc: Atom probe microscopes use controlled either voltage or laser pulsing to trigger a sequence of field evaporation events. Many microscopes have a laser installed enabling measurements of poorly conductive specimens.
    name:
    manufacturer_name:
      doc: Name of the manufacturer who built/constructed the laser unit.
    manufacturer_model:
      doc: Hardware name/serial number or hash identifier given by the manufacturer to identify the laser unit.
    wavelength(NX_FLOAT):
      doc: Wavelength of the radiation.
      unit: NX_WAVELENGTH
    power(NX_FLOAT)
      doc: Source power
      unit: NX_POWER
    pinhole_to_specimen(NXtransformations):
      doc: Geometrical description how the laser focusing optics/pinhole-attached coordinate system has to be transformed to align with the specimen coordinate system. A right-handed Cartesian coordinate system is assumed whose positive z-axis points into the direction of the laser beam, i.e. towards the specimen.
  beam(NXbeam):
    doc: Optional place for describing details about the focused laser beam with which the specimen is illuminated to trigger field evaporation events.
#laser pulsing unit make this an own base class or use NXbeam and NXsource, discuss eventually in consolidation workshop
  hv_pulser(NXapm_hv_pulser):
    doc: Optionally installed voltage system for inducing field evaporation via high-voltage electric pulsing.
