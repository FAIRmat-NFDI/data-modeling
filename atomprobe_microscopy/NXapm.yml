  program_name:
    exists: recommended
    doc: Commercial or otherwise given name to the program that was used to acquire/measure the dataset. Atom probe microscopy experiments are nowadays still in most cases operated/performed via commercial integrated acquisition and instrument control software. For AMETEK LEAP instruments the least processed (rawest) numerical results and metadata are stored in so-called RHIT and HITS files and supplementary metadata in the database that is connected to the control software. RHIT and HITS are proprietary binary file formats whose content must not be accessed with software other than of AMETEK (IVAS/APSuite). In effect, RHIT and HITS store the experiment in a closed manner that is practically useless without having the commercial software. To arrive at a state that atom probe microscopy delivers a dataset with which one can study atomic position and do composition analyses, these raw data have to be processed. Therefore, for an application definition to be useful it needs to store details about the physical acquisition of the raw data and all its processing steps to arrive at derived quantities like ion hit positions (on the detector), calibrated time-of-flight data, and from calibrated mass-to-charge-state ratios, and tomographically reconstructed computed atomic positions. In many cases cases an APM dataset is useful only if its post-processed via so-called ranging. Ranging defines a set of rules how to map between tof and mass-to-charge data on ion types to decode elemental identities. All these steps are in most cases performed using commercial software. Frequently, though, ranging is also performed in (open-source) research software. Therefore, there is strictly speaking not a single program used in atom probe to arrive at a useful reconstructed and ranged dataset. Hence, the reason to design the application definition with the acquisition and key post-processing steps.

  atom_probe(NXinstrument):
    exists: required
    doc: An atom probe microscope is fundamentally different to a large-scale facility accelerator or electron microscope in at least two ways. First, ionized atoms and molecular ions ions and/or the imaging gas ions (in the case of field ion microscopy) are accelerated towards a position-sensitive and time-of-flight taking detector system. Hence, there is no real beam. This also causes that second the specimen is the lens of the an atom probe microscope. Therefore, we modify the reference coordinate system that is usually referred to in NeXus - the McStas coordinate system. We call the reference coordinate system the specimen coordinate system. To be consistent with accelerator and microscopy techniques we define that the positive z-axis points outwards from the apex of the specimen into the vacuum towards the detector. The coordinate system remains/is a right-handed one. We define clockwise rotations to be positive.

      (NXtransformations):
        doc: Affine transformation which aligns the Cartesian right-handed coordinate system which defines the detector space with the specimen space. In atom probe microscopy a frequently used choice is to discuss the so-called detector space image (stack). This is a stack of two-dimensional histograms of detected ions within a predefined evaporation ID interval. Typically, the set of ion evaporation sequence IDs is grouped into chunks. For each chunk a histogram of the ion hit positions on the detector is computed. This leaves the possibility for inconsistency between the so-called detector coordinate system and a specimen-affixed coordinate system. The transformation here can resolve this ambiguity as it clarifies how the positive z-axes of either coordinate systems can be oriented.

    control_software(NXcollection):
      doc: The majority of atom probe microscopes comes from a single commercial manufacturer AMETEK (formerly Cameca). Their instruments are controlled via an(/a set) of integrated instrument control system(s) (APSuite/IVAS/Davis). By contrast, instruments which were built by individual research groups such as of the French (GPM, Rouen, France), the Schmitz (Inspico, Stuttgart, Germany), the Felfer (Oxcart, Erlangen, Germany), or the PNNL group (Pacific Northwest National Laborary, Portland, Oregon, U.S.) have individual solutions to control the instrument. Some of which are modularized and open, some of which realize also integrated control units with portions of eventually undisclosed source code and lacking open APIs. Currently, the is no community-specific API for getting finely granularized access to such control settings. This motivates the current design of the application definition via a collection. Holding heterogeneous, not yet standardized pieces of information is the purpose of this collection.

In the first draft of the application definition we do not wish to resolve or generalize these differences. Rather the purpose of this collection is to provide a container where the model specific parameters and calibration models can be stored that define the voltage-and-bowl correction. For AMETEK LEAP systems this should be the place for storing initial calibration values, which typically (only) AMETEK service engineers calibrate for the detector and instrument. Furthermore, one could then also store here the iteratively identified calibrations which scientists will get displayed in e.g. APSuite while executing the voltage-and-bowl correction as part of the reconstruction pipeline.

      reconstruction_parameter(NXcollection):
        doc: Different models and associated algorithms, i.e. (numerical) protocols exist to reconstruct atom probe data. Although these approaches are qualitatively similar, each protocol uses different parameters (and interprets these differently). The source code to reconstruction protocols of the IVAS/APSuite software, which the large majority of experiments uses when analyzing atom probe experiments, is not open. Therefore, it is difficult for now to generalize the meaning and idea behind all relevant reconstruction parameters. One could create a class for each reconstruction method, as these methods are de facto application definitions. For now we store the reconstruction parameter in a collection.
