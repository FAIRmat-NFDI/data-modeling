# a draft version of a NeXus application definition for storing atom probe microscopy (atom probe tomography and field-ion microscopy) experiments
# the draft is strongly inspired by the instrument use case of the so-called local electrode atom probe (LEAP) of CAMECA/Ametek but can also handle
# community-built instrument like the Oxcart instrument of the Felfer group

Often though it is useful to specify a time interval with specifying both start_time and end_time to allow for more detailed bookkeeping and interpretation of the experiment. The user should be aware that even with having both time instances specified it may not be advisable to infer how long the experiment took or for how long data were acquired. More detailed timing data over the course of the experiment have to be collected."

    program_name:
      doc: "Commercial or otherwise given name to the program that was used to acquire/measure the dataset. Atom probe microscopy experiments are nowadays still in most cases controlled via commercial software. These are often designed as integrated acquisition and instrument control software. For AMETEK/Cameca local electrode atom probe (LEAP) instruments the least processed (rawest) numerical results and metadata are stored in so-called RHIT and HITS files, which are proprietary. Supplementary metadata are kept in a database which is connected to the control software. RHIT and HITS are proprietary binary file formats whose content must not be accessed with software other than of AMETEK (IVAS/AP Suite). In effect, RHIT and HITS store the experiment in a closed manner that is practically useless for users unless they have access to the commercial software. To arrive at a state that atom probe microscopy delivers a dataset with which one can study reconstructed atomic position and do e.g. composition analyses or other post-processing analysis tasks, these raw data have to be processed. Therefore, it is necessary that for an application definition to be useful details about the physical acquisition of the raw data and all its processing steps have to be stored to arrive at derived quantities like ion hit positions (on the detector), calibrated time-of-flight data, and from these results obtain calibrated mass-to-charge-state ratios, and finally the tomographically reconstructed atomic positions. In many cases cases, an APM dataset is useful only if it gets post-processed via so-called ranging. Ranging defines a set of rules how to map between time-of-flight and mass-to-charge data on ion types with which in turn one can decode elemental identities and resolve isotopes. All these steps are in most cases performed using commercial software. Frequently, though, ranging and post-processing is also performed with (open-source) research software. Therefore, there is strictly speaking not a single program used in atom probe to arrive at a useful reconstructed and ranged dataset. Hence, the reason to design the application definition with the acquisition and key post-processing steps."

For other instruments, such as the one from Stuttgart or Oxcart from Erlangen, or the instruments in Rouen, use the identifier that is closest in meaning to the LEAP run number. As a destructive microscopy method, a run can be performed only once. It is possible, however, to interrupt a run and restart, still all using the same specimen. In this case, each evaporation run needs to be distinguished with different run numbers. # This is how most atom probe groups handle it across the globe."

An atom probe microscope (experiment) is different compared to a large-scale facility accelerator or an electron microscope in at least two ways. First, ionized atoms and molecular ion(s fragments) (in the case of atom probe tomography) and (primarily) imaging gas ions (in the case of field ion microscopy) are accelerated towards a position-sensitive and time-of-flight taking detector system. Hence, there is no real probe/beam. Second, the specimen is the lens of an atom probe microscope. Therefore, the reference coordinate system that is usually referred to in NeXus (McStas coordinate system) is modified when using this application definition. Specifically, the reference coordinate system is defined such that it represents the specimen coordinate system. To be consistent with accelerator and microscopy techniques we define that the positive z-axis points outwards from the apex of the specimen into the vacuum, i.e. towards the detector. The coordinate system remains/is a right-handed one. Clockwise rotations are considered positive rotations."

In atom probe microscopy a frequently used choice is to discuss the so-called detector space image (stack). This is a stack of two-dimensional histograms of detected ions within a predefined evaporation ID interval. Typically, the set of ion evaporation sequence IDs is grouped into chunks. For each chunk a histogram of the ion hit positions on the detector is computed. This leaves the possibility for inconsistency between the so-called detector coordinate system and a specimen-affixed coordinate system. The transformation here resolves this ambiguity by specifying how the positive z-axes of either coordinate systems can be oriented."
