  description:
    doc: "Free-text field to specify further details about the reflectron."
  (NXtransformations):
    doc: "Affine transformation(s) which detail where the reflectron is located relative to e.g. the origin of the specimen space reference coordinate system. This group can also be used for specifying how the reflectron is rotated to the specimen axis. The purpose of these more detailed instrument descriptions is to support the creation of a digital twin of the instrument for computational science."
