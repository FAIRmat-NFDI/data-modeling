doc: Draft for a class which can be used for representing a coarse-grained description of all those components of an atom probe microscope which realize the pulsing capabilities, whether it be for the laser or the high-voltage pulsing to trigger ionization.
(NXpulser_apm):
  symbols:
    Ntlogs: Number of individual measurements
  laser_pulser(NXsource):
    exists: optional
    doc: Atom probe microscopes use controlled either voltage or laser pulsing to trigger a sequence of field evaporation events. Many microscopes have a laser installed enabling measurements of poorly conductive specimens.
    name:
    manufacturer_name:
      doc: Name of the manufacturer who built/constructed the laser unit.
    manufacturer_model:
      doc: Hardware name/serial number or hash identifier given by the manufacturer to identify the laser unit.
    wavelength(NX_FLOAT):
      doc: Wavelength of the laser radiation.
      unit: NX_WAVELENGTH
    power(NX_FLOAT):
      doc: Source power
      unit: NX_POWER
    #why is the laser energy often a range because the laser energy is time-dependently adjusted?
    pinhole_to_specimen(NXtransformations):
      doc: Geometrical description how the laser focusing optics/pinhole-attached coordinate system has to be transformed to align with the specimen coordinate system. A right-handed Cartesian coordinate system, the so-called laser space, is assumed whose positive z-axis points into the direction of the propagating laser beam, i.e. towards the specimen.
  beam(NXbeam):
    doc: Optional place for describing details about the focused laser beam with which the specimen is illuminated.
    #laser pulsing unit make this an own base class or use NXbeam and NXsource, discuss eventually in consolidation workshop
    laser_pinhole_position(NXcollection):
      doc: Track time-dependent settings over the course of the measurement where the laser beam exits the focusing optics.
    laser_impact_position(NXcollection):
      doc: Track time-dependent settings over the course of the measurement where the laser hits the specimen.

  #how can one store a spatio-temporal profile, own class for this?
  pulse_fraction(NX_NUMBER):
    exists: recommended
    doc: to be defined
    unit: NX_UNITLESS #how else to specify percent, there is not NX_PERCENT
