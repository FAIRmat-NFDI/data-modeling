#a draft version of a NeXus application definition for arpes,
#the existing NXarpes is too restrictive, this application definition aims at generalizing it
#to be agnostic of the experimental details.
#the draft uses the application example of a simple 2D slice through the k-space, the elementary unit of
#arpes measurements.
#It uses only existing NeXus base classes. It is designed to be extended by other application definitions
# with higher granularity in the data description.

# Allowed probe to be both x-ray AND ultraviolet
# Removed mandatory NXmonochromator: laser beamlines, many helium lamps do not have one.
# Replaced NXmonochromator with the more flexible NXbeam
# The "slits" are changed into an aperture object that is more flexible
# Added an "energy_resolution" item, this simplifies greatly the retrieval of very important information


name: NXarpes_core # Decided to use "core" to avoid confusion with "base class"
