  type:

    enumeration: ["single", "double", "quadrupole", "hexapole", "octupole"]
  name:
    doc: "Colloquial or short name for the lens. For manufacturer names and identifiers use respective manufacturer fields."
  manufacturer_name:

  model:

  description:
    doc: "Ideally an identifier, persistent link, or free text which gives further details about the lens."

  (NXtransformations):
    doc: "Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe the location and geometry of the corrector as a component in the instrument. Conventions from the NXtransformations base class are used. In principle, the McStas coordinate system is used. The origin of the coordinate system is placed in the center of the gun pinhole as the virtual point-like assumed source of the electron beam. A right-handed coordinate system is assumed whose positive z-axis points in the direction of the propagating electron beam."
